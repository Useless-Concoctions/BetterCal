# Changelog

All notable changes to **BetterCal** will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Smart Goals Engine**: Predictive ghost slots for recurring objectives. "Penciled-in" sessions that you can confirm or bounce with a single click.
- **Liquid Task Inbox**: A flickable panel on the right for unstructured tasks. Drag tasks onto the calendar to solidify them into time blocks.
- **Subscription Layers**: Added support for layered views (Personal, Work) accessible via the 'Views' dropdown.
- **Superior NLP Parser**: Intelligent event parsing that handles complex structures (e.g., "Meeting Sammy at 7pm for Drinks") without losing context.
- **Ambient Vibe Tinting**: The entire UI dynamically tints its border and logo colors based on your current focus block (Focus Blue, Social Rose, etc.).

### Changed
- **Header Proportions**: Restored the 'BetterCal' logo to a bold 19px weight and refined navigation link spacing for a more distinct visual hierarchy.
- **Predictive Slotting UI**: Redesigned the command bar preview with a high-tech monospace aesthetic and "Vibe Indicator" bars.
- **VOID UI Refinements**: Further reduction of visual noise; tucked subscription toggles into a dropdown to keep the header pristine.

### Fixed
- Calendar grid alignment issues across different viewport sizes.
- Date logic for highlighting "Today" and handling cross-month boundaries.
- Command bar "Live Preview" parsing logic to handle days of the week.
